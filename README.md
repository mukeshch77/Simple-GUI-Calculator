# Simple-GUI-Calculator

### Develop a simple calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using tkinter.

  The Python GUI calculator provided is a user-friendly, stylish application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. Developed using tkinter, Pythonâ€™s powerful standard GUI library, this calculator has a sleek, modern appearance, with a dark theme and bright buttons that make it visually appealing and easy to use.

  ### Key Features
   * Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   * Expression Evaluation: Evaluates arithmetic expressions entered by the user in real-time.
   * Calculation History: Maintains a list of previous calculations and displays them upon request.
   * Clear Button: Clears the current input to start fresh.
   * Exit Button: Closes the application.

  ### Application Structure
  
  ### GUI Layout
  
   * Main Window: The calculator window is created using Tkinter, with a black background and white buttons for all operations and digits.
   * Entry Field: Displays the current expression and result of the calculation.
   * Buttons:
      * Buttons for digits (0-9) and operators (+, -, *, /).
      * A button for evaluating the expression (=), clearing the entry (AC), and viewing the history (History).
      * An "Exit" button to close the application.
  
  ### How to Use the Calculator
  
   1. Perform Calculations:
      * Click on the buttons to enter numbers and operators.
      * Click the = button to evaluate the expression.
      * The result will be displayed in the entry field.
      

  2. Clear the Expression:
      * To clear the current expression, click the "AC" (All Clear) button.
